# STL_Containers in CPP
ft_containers: A C++ project to re-implement fundamental STL containers.
ft_containers is a C++ project that involves re-implementing some of the fundamental Standard Template Library (STL) containers, including but not limited to vectors, maps, and stacks. The goal of the project is to gain a deep understanding of how these data structures work and how they can be implemented in C++.


## Overview

ft_containers project is a great way to learn about the internal workings of STL containers and how to implement them efficiently in C++. The project typically requires students to implement the following:

- Template classes for generic containers that can store different types of data.
- Iterator classes for traversing the elements stored in the containers.
- Memory management functions for allocating and deallocating memory as needed.
- Correct and efficient implementations of all the public and private member functions of the STL containers.
- Thorough testing of the implemented containers to ensure that they work correctly.

## Key aspects

* Template classes: The ft_containers project often requires the use of C++ template classes to create generic containers that can store different types of data. This allows the containers to be reused for a variety of tasks, without having to write separate implementations for each data type.
* Iterators: Iterators provide a way to traverse the elements stored in a container. The ft_containers project requires students to implement iterator classes for their containers, so that users can easily iterate through the elements and perform operations on them.
* Memory management: Proper memory management is essential for any C++ program, but it is especially important for the ft_containers project. Students must carefully consider how to allocate and deallocate memory for their containers to avoid memory leaks and other errors.
* Correctness and efficiency: The re-implemented containers should not only produce correct results but also be efficient in terms of time and space complexity. Students are encouraged to consider performance optimizations when implementing their containers.
* Testing: It is important to thoroughly test the implemented containers to ensure that they work correctly. This may involve writing test cases and comparing the results of the custom containers with the STL containers.

ft_containers project is a valuable learning experience for students who are interested in learning about C++ data structures and algorithms. The project helps students to develop a deep understanding of how these data structures work and how to implement them efficiently in C++. Additionally, the project teaches students important skills such as memory management, testing.

## Conclusion

This project is a challenging but rewarding project for C++ students. By completing the project, students will gain a deep understanding of STL containers and how to implement them efficiently in C++.
